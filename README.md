# Disclaimer
This project is created for personal learning purposes, and its primary goal is to explore and practice various concepts and technologies of 3D rendering. It is not intended to be a fully polished or production-ready solution.

## Goals
my goals for this project were:
- Making an Engine that i can play with and test stuff whenever i learn something new
- Making a game engine as simple as possible
- Producing high-quality modern code
- Dealing with a long-term project

## Build process
just git clone --recursive and you good to go ! (for now)

# Details
## 1. Software
- Visual Studio 2022 (previous versions should also be supported)

## 2. Dependencies
